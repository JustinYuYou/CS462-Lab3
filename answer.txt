1. Explain how the collect_temperatures rule and the temperatures function work as an event-query API.
collect_temperatures works like a POST where it append the temperatures into the list
temperatures works like a GET where it returns a list of temperatures

2. Explain your strategy for finding temperatures that are in range.
I am iterating through the collected temperature list and use a index function to filter out the one not in the violated temperature map

3. What happens if provides doesn't list the name of the temperatures function?
Then we will not able to have those functions acceessible to other ruleset when using it as a module.

4. What happens if shares doesn't list the name of the temperatures function?
Then we will not able to call those function outside the ruleset
